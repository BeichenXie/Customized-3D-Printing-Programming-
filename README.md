# Customized-3D-Printing-Programming

3D printer usually prints layer by layer, but printing at Z direction opens up more design opportunities and better aesthetics.

Two projects are developed using different techniques to create light frame 3D prints.

The first project takes the data and parameters from the frame text to design printing patterns for any form. The nozzle moves up and down to generate arc or wave toolpaths, which improves efficiency of printing and create a translucent visual. The team will be keep experimenting on variations of patterns and creating a library for light frame printing for any form.

The second project focuses on testing 3D printed origami using regular PLA material at a relatively small scale. To test the viability we started with mimicking existing origami studies with 3D printing plastic material. The challenge here is to experiment on how different printing patterns, affected by toolpaths, extrusion rate, and feedrate, can contribute to the folding process. We the produced a series of 3D printed folding objects to show what this printing method can achieve.
