# Customized-3D-Printing-Programming

3D printer usually prints layer by layer, but printing at Z direction opens up more design opportunities and better aesthetics.
This project takes the data and parameters from the frame text to design printing patterns for any form. The nozzle moves up and down to generate arc or wave toolpaths, which improves efficiency of printing and create a translucent visual. The team will be keep experimenting on variations of patterns and creating a library for light frame printing for any form.
